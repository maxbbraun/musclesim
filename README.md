# Artificial Muscle Simulator

[大阪大学 “ゆらぎ”プロジェクト](http://www.yuragi.osaka-u.ac.jp) (2007)

Understanding and utilizing fluctuation effects is the motivation behind the interdisciplinary Yuragi Project. One specific application of this principle is the control of a complex, biologically inspired robotic arm based on the Attractor Selection Model. A simulator for the robot's artificial muscles has been developed in order to evaluate this approach. The Artificial Muscle Simulator introduces a model of the flexible pneumatic actuators which accurately reproduces their behavior. It has been designed to be highly customizable, allowing for other robot models and control methods.

This repository contains the [whitepaper](docs/whitepaper.pdf) and [presentation](docs/presentation.pdf) describing the robotic arm and simulator as well as the [source code](sim/) and [documentation](docs/documentation.pdf) for using it.
